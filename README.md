Hi, I’m @ianef
- 👀 I’m interested in Symfony full stack development with Vue front end technology. Some .NET and occasionally other stuff as required.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning something new every day, that's life as a developer!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything you think I can help with. 
- 💰 I develop bespoke applications for businesses mainly in the East Midlands, UK, but happy to consider anything.
- 🥁 I love playing samba reggae percussion, come and join me in Wirksworth on Wednesday evenings.
- 🎬 I do VJ projection for the Exile Music Festival and occasional other gigs.
- 📫 You can reach me at ianfoulds@x-act.co.uk.
